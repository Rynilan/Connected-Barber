Project of a system to a barber shop, which 'll manage the clients, appointments, services,  
products and workers.

# Background

A project made by the students of SENAC institution, me and my friends, the memebers of this  
repository, with the guidance of our teachers, [Fábio](https://github.com/antoniofabioqueiroz/) and [Wayne](https://www.instagram.com/waynejr_10/), with the requirements  
of a barber class on the same institution. This is our first large project in group to learn  
and maybe start our path on the tech world.
