Project of a system to a barber shop, which 'll manage the clients, appointments, services,

# Background

A project made by the students of SENAC institution, me and my friends, the memebers of this  
repository, with the guidance of our teacher, [Fábio](https://github.com/antoniofabioqueiroz/),  
with the requirements of a barber class on the same institution.  
This is our first large project in group to learn and maybe start our path on the tech world.
